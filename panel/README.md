# Layout

- Jacks at the top, controls at the bottom
- 14mm spacing between jacks (center to center) in both directions
- Knob/switch spacing?

- 1HP=1/5"=5.08mm
  - standard graph paper is 5 squares per inch, meaning exactly 1 real world HP per square
- 84 HPs (426mm) of usable horizontal space in a 19" rack
- 3U=128.5mm
  - 112.5mm of useable vertical space after leaving room for mounting screws
- Maximum control density:
  - jacks = 14mm wide, 9mm high (12+ recommended)
  - knobs = 22mm square (30mm recommended)
    - note: some knobs have 21mm base and need to be bigger
- each jack is 3HP wide, each knob is 5 or 6HP wide
